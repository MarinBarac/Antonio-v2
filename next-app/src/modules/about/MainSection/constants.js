    A self-taught UI/UX designer, functioning in the industry for 4+ years now,
    I started as a graphic designer who can design simple websites to find out
    later that I could call myself UX/UI designer and charge the same thing
    twice as much.
    <br />
    <br />
    In my early twenties started to work as a freelance graphic designer doing
    ugly club flyers in Photoshop. Between then and now, I finish my
    bachelor&apos;s in Business economics and master&apos;s in Marketing and
    communication.
    <br />
    <br />
    Almost three years ago, I bet with my software dev. girlfriend that I can
    learn to code and get a job offer just to prove to her that people who
    design for a living are not only good at “playing with watercolors.“
    <br />
    <br />
    After finishing the course and getting a job offer for iOS dev, I decided
    that I&apos;m not into typing code all day long, but I also didn&apos;t want
    to move from the IT sector. And when you mix graphic design and IT, you get
    a beautiful and expensive cocktail named: UX/UI design.
    <br />
    <br />
    To fully leverage my business-side brain, I finished the Dribbble course for
    the Product designer and learned how to get the most out of a product by
    solving user problems and making the company richer than the day before.
    <br />
    <br />
    Since then, I have worked on various projects (Saas platforms, web shops,
    marketing sites) at my current company and as a freelance.
